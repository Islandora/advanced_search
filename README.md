## Introduction
The Advanced Search module provides keyword search, field search, boolean search, and search within collections and sub collections. It provides a pager UI component that allows the user to set the number of items to show, select sort criteria and display style (grid or list). It provides a global search block, which redirects the search query to a search page. It also enables the use of Ajax with views (powered by Solr), search blocks, facets, and search results.

## Features and Advantages

The module provides Boolean search, enables you to use AND, OR or NOT options to helps expanding or narrowing your search parameters.

## Requirements

Advanced Search requires an installation of Solr, as its syntax is Solr-specific.
The Advanced Search blocks also utilize the Facets API, therefore they only work on Views where Facets are enabled.

The following requirements (Drupal modules) will be downloaded automatically by Composer:

- [facets](https://www.drupal.org/project/facets)
- [search_api_solr](https://www.drupal.org/project/search_api_solr)

You do not need to use Islandora, however the instructions below for setting up search within a collection 
(and optionally, its subcollections) use an pattern that is used by Islandora whereby nodes are organized 
in a hierarchy using an Entity Reference field (typically called "Member Of" / `field_member_of`) on a node
that accepts other nodes as values. If you are using Advanced Search and want to make use
of "Search Sub-collections" then you will need to set up such a field on your content type(s).

## Installation

This module is part of the [Islandora Starter Site](https://github.com/Islandora-Devops/islandora-starter-site), which is a full Drupal site setup that includes
Solr, and automatically sets up the views and facets required for Advanced Search to work. 

To download and enable just this module, use the following from the command line:

```bash
composer require drupal/advanced_search
drush en advanced_search
```

## Configuration

This module will make the following blocks available for every _display_
of a Search API view:
* Advanced Search Block
* Pager Block

This module also provides a block called "Search" that you can place and configure as a global search block.

You can configure these blocks to show up on pages with their respective views using Drupal's Block interface. 

You can set the following configuration at
`/admin/config/search/advanced`:

![Config screen, showing sections for Advanced Search Block, Pager Block, Advanced Search, and Facets](https://github.com/Islandora/advanced_search/assets/1943338/004c7932-6918-4036-8bfd-b9bf27b88f6f)


## Configuring Solr

Please review
[Islandora Documentation](https://islandora.github.io/documentation/user-documentation/searching/)
before continuing. The following assumes you already have a working Solr and the
Drupal Search API setup.

## Extended Dismax (eDismax) Search

Read the [Drupal.org documentation on Solr Query Parsers](https://www.drupal.org/docs/contributed-modules/search-api-solr/solr-query-parsers) to find more detail about
eDismax Search in Drupal.

You can enable Extended Dismax search on this module's configuration page at
`admin/config/islandora/advanced_search`. This will affect all Advanced Search
and Search blocks provided by this module.



## Configure Collection Search

See "Requirements" for a discussion of the use of `field_member_of`.

To support collection based searches you need to index the `field_member_of` for
every node as well define a new Search API field that captures the full
hierarchy of `field_member_of` for each repository item.

Add a new `Content` Search API field `field_decedent_of` to the index at
`admin/config/search/search-api/index/[your default index]/fields`.

![image](./docs/field_decedent_of.png)

Then under `admin/config/search/search-api/index/[your default index]/processors`
enable `Index hierarchy` and setup the new field to index the hierarchy.

![image](./docs/enable_index_hierarchy.png)

![image](./docs/enable_index_hierarchy_processor.png)

The field can now be used limit a search to all the decedents of a given object.
See the section below, "Collection search", to finish configuring your site
for collection and sub-collection search.

> N.B. You may have to re-index to make sure the field is populated.

## Configure Views

Create a Search API view that uses your index. 

The configuration of views is outside of the scope of this document, please read
the [Drupal Documentation](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/core/modules/views), as
well as the
[Search API Documentation](https://www.drupal.org/docs/contributed-modules/search-api).

However, do NOT add the "Fulltext search" filter, despite that it is the "usual" way of
setting up a Search view. All fulltext searching (and fielded searching) will 
be handled by blocks provided by this module.

### Exposed Form

Solr views allow the user to configure an exposed form (_optionally as a
block_). This form / block is **different** from the
[Advanced Search Block](#advanced-search-block). This module does not make any
changes to the form, but this form can cause the Advanced Search Block to not
function if configured incorrectly.

The Advanced Search Block requires that if present the Exposed forms
`Exposed form style` is set to `Basic` rather than `Input Required`. As
`Input Required` will prevent any search from occurring unless the user puts an
additional query in the Exposed form as well.

![Form Style](./docs/basic-input.png)

### Collection Search

This module's "Advanced Search" block can be set up on a 
"collection" (or, generically, on hierarchical entities
that can contain other entities). This block allows the user
to select whether they want the search to include sub-collections.

![image](./docs/include_subcollections.png)

The following instructions describe how to set up this feature.

![image](./docs/view_advanced_setting.png)

Here a relationship is setup with `Member Of` field and we have **two**
contextual filters:

1. `field_member_of` (Direct decedents of the Entity)
2. `field_decedent_of` (All decedents of the Entity)

Both of these filters are configured the exact same way.

![image](./docs/contextual_filter_settings.png)

These filters are toggled by the Advanced Search block to allow the search to
include all decedents or just direct decedents (*documented below*).

### Paging

The paging options specified here can have an affect on the pager block
(*documented below*).

![image](./docs/pager_settings.png)

### Sorting

Additional the fields listed as `Sort Criteria` as `Exposed` will be made
available in the pager block (*documented below*).

![image](./docs/sort_criteria.png)

### Search Highlighting

1. Add Search Excerpt to the Advanced Search View.
    - Navigate to `/admin/structure/views/view/advanced_search`. In the `Fields` section, click `Add`, then select `Search Excerpt`.'
    
    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106131209/225054405-122b2d9d-1aec-4ac9-9e72-8a99a679f8e6.png)
    
2. Turn on Search API highlight processor
    - Navigate to `/admin/config/search/search-api` > Edit Index > Processors > Enable Highlight processor. 
    
    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106131209/225055386-8c2d279c-e4c6-4123-8e89-f139ac4862d9.png)
    
    - At the bottom of the form, under Processor Settings > Highlight > Select `Create excerpt`.
    
    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106131209/225055763-33e9c122-e2aa-452e-9158-ebf24076f0f8.png)
    
3. Configure Solr Server.
    - Navigate to `/admin/config/search/search-api` > Edit Server > Configure Solr backend > Advanced > Select `Retrieve highlighted snippets`.
    
    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106131209/225057771-c42c5751-c63f-4170-9b48-d443f02b7d8f.png)

### Result Summary

In your view, in the `Header` section, clikc `Add`, then search and select for "Result summary".

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7862086/222479508-7fd97c65-11d5-496d-8e5a-9e019c82f097.png)

Then, paste the following code to `Display` textarea in `Configure Header: Global: Result summary`

````
<div id="ajax-page-summary" class="pager__summary">Displaying @start - @end of @total</div>
````

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7862086/222480250-ddedb959-1c0b-4558-8f9f-f1d2ec1107ec.png)



<!--- ## Configure Facets

The facets can be configured at `admin/config/search/facets`. Facets are linked
to a **Source** which is a **Search API View Display** so it will be typically
to have to duplicate your configuration for a given facet across each of the
displays where you want it to show up.

### Include / Exclude Facets

To be able to display exclude facet links as well as include links in the facets
block we have to duplicate the configuration for the facet like so.

![image](./docs/include_exclude_facets.png)

Both the include / exclude facets must use the widget
`List of links that allow the user to include / exclude facets`

![image](./docs/include_exclude_facets_settings.png)

The excluded facet also needs the following settings to appear and function
correctly.

The `URL alias` must match the same value as the include facet except it must be
prefixed with `~` character that is what links to the two facets to each other.

![image](./docs/exclude_facet_settings_url_alias.png)

And it must also explicitly be set to exclude:

![image](./docs/exclude_facet_settings_exclude.png)

You may also want to enable `Hide active items` and `Hide non-narrowing results`
for a cleaner presentation of facets.
--->
## Configure Blocks

For each block type:

- Facet
- Pager
- Advanced Search

There will be **one block** per `View Display`. The block should be limited to
only appear when the view it was derived from is also being displayed on the
same page.

This requires configuring the `visibility` of the block as appropriate. For
collection based searches be sure to limit the display of the Facets block to
the models you want to display the search on, e.g:

![image](./docs/facet_block_settings.png)

### Advanced Search Block

For any valid search field, you can drag / drop and reorder the fields to
display in the advanced search form on. The configuration resides on the block
so this can differ across views / displays if need be. Additionally if the View
the block was derived from has multiple contextual filters you can choose which
one corresponds to direct children, this will enable the recursive search
checkbox.

![image](./docs/advanced_search_block_settings.png)

> N.B. Be aware that the Search views [Exposed Form](#exposed-form) can have an
> affect on the function of the
> [Advanced Search Block](#advanced-search-block). Please refer to that section
> to learn more.

### Search Block (NEW)

To associate this simple search block to a Advanced Search Result Page view,
you can select its machine name in the dropdown list. With that, this form
will redirect to the view with search parameters.

You can also change the search form's appearance by changing the default label,
placeholder text for the search text field, and search button.
